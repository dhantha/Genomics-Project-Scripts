the scirpt is used for appending tax id to diamond output for protein
diamond output should be in .m8 (tab) format

the script works by looking up tax id with accession number (without version number)
a mapping file can be obtained from ncbi website (3 files ending with .accession2tax)
the mapping file should be combined and sorted in order to perform binary search
note that locale matters as it could affect the order between lettters and underscore
("_" before "A" or "_" after "A"?)

for accession that cannot be found in these dump, the script will now attempt to lookup on NCBI website
lookup frequency is limited in order to prevent IP from being banned 
those newly looked up accession to taxon id mapping will be written to a seperate file
(importing of this seperate mapping file is not yet supported)
if internet connection is unreliable, please disable online lookup by the arg --offline

Assumptions:
  in the m8 file, the majority of accession id can be found in acc2tax map
  line order in m8 does NOT matter
  if accession has "|" in it, look up with the characters after "|"
  if accession appears to be "????_??" where the laster 2 characters are the same, remove the last character

functionality of this script has been tested with diamond version 0.8.36 and MEGAN 5
(It may not work with MEGAN 6)
as of 03/20/2017: 
  the script is mainly single-threaded
  memory usage is about 38 GB
  the mapping file has 435808789 entries

example:
python add_taxid_v3.py --map accession2taxid.sorted ./diamond_out/*.m8
find -name "*.m8" | xargs python add_taxid_v3.py --map accession2taxid.sorted
